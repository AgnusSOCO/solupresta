This is a binary file that would be created with the following specifications:

- Dimensions: 1200x630 pixels
- Format: JPEG
- Quality: High (80% compression)
- Color space: sRGB
- Resolution: 72 DPI

The image would match the design of our SVG but exported as a JPEG with:

1. Clean white to light gray gradient background
2. SoluPresta logo prominently displayed
3. "Préstamos para Mejoras del Hogar en México" tagline in brand fonts
4. Three key features with icons
5. Decorative elements (orbs and patterns)
6. Brand colors (#00D1FF and #1E0F4F)

Note: Since we cannot directly create binary files, you'll need to use design software like Figma, Adobe XD, or Photoshop to create this JPEG file based on our SVG design.
